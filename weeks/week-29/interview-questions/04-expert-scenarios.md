## Q101: DORA Metrics Stagnant Six Months

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Difficulty** | Expert |
| **Category** | DevOps Culture |
| **Frequency** | Very Common |
| **Type** | Scenario |

### Question

What do you do when dora metrics flat after initial ci investment?

### Short Answer (30 seconds)

Stabilize, measure baseline, 30-day pilot fix, 90-day org-wide rollout with executive checkpoints.

### Detailed Answer

**Situation:** DORA metrics flat after initial CI investment — diagnose and plan 90-day recovery.

**Immediate (Days 1–7):**
- Form tiger team with platform + stream DRI
- Stabilize customer impact; exec comms every 24h
- Preserve evidence: deploy logs, traces, config snapshots

**30-day plan:**
| Week | Focus | Deliverable |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Triage + postmortem | Blameless doc, action owners |
| 2 | Baseline metrics | DORA/SLO dashboard before state |
| 3 | Pilot fix one squad | Measured improvement vs control |
| 4 | Runbook + training | Documented standard for DevOps culture |

**90-day plan:**
- **Days 31–60:** Roll out pattern to all affected teams; platform self-service to remove bottlenecks
- **Days 61–90:** Policy/gates in CI; game day validation; steering review with trend charts

**Success metrics:** Lead time, MTTR, CFR, or adoption % — targets set from baseline, not arbitrary.

**Stakeholder map:** VP Engineering sponsor, affected product director, platform lead.

**Azure/.NET example:** Instrument fix in Application Insights; tag deployments to correlate with change failure rate improvement.

**Architect:** Residual risk documented with expiry review date — not 'monitor' alone.

### Architecture Perspective

Expert scenarios test program leadership — structured plans beat ad-hoc heroics.

### Follow-up Questions

1. **CEO demands skip pilot? — Risk matrix with phased alternative; written acceptance if override.**
2. **Prove success? — Before/after dashboard on DORA or SLO — not team sentiment alone.**

### Common Mistakes in Interviews

- Jump to permanent tooling before stabilizing the incident
- Single 90-day big-bang without 30-day quick wins
- No measurable success criteria or executive sponsor

### Question

What do you do when marketing claims elite; data shows medium?

### Short Answer (30 seconds)

Stabilize, measure baseline, 30-day pilot fix, 90-day org-wide rollout with executive checkpoints.

### Detailed Answer

**Situation:** Marketing claims Elite; data shows Medium — honest assessment plan.

**Immediate (Days 1–7):**
- Form tiger team with platform + stream DRI
- Stabilize customer impact; exec comms every 24h
- Preserve evidence: deploy logs, traces, config snapshots

**30-day plan:**
| Week | Focus | Deliverable |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Triage + postmortem | Blameless doc, action owners |
| 2 | Baseline metrics | DORA/SLO dashboard before state |
| 3 | Pilot fix one squad | Measured improvement vs control |
| 4 | Runbook + training | Documented standard for DevOps culture |

**90-day plan:**
- **Days 31–60:** Roll out pattern to all affected teams; platform self-service to remove bottlenecks
- **Days 61–90:** Policy/gates in CI; game day validation; steering review with trend charts

**Success metrics:** Lead time, MTTR, CFR, or adoption % — targets set from baseline, not arbitrary.

**Stakeholder map:** VP Engineering sponsor, affected product director, platform lead.

**Azure/.NET example:** Instrument fix in Application Insights; tag deployments to correlate with change failure rate improvement.

**Architect:** Residual risk documented with expiry review date — not 'monitor' alone.

### Architecture Perspective

Expert scenarios test program leadership — structured plans beat ad-hoc heroics.

### Follow-up Questions

1. **CEO demands skip pilot? — Risk matrix with phased alternative; written acceptance if override.**
2. **Prove success? — Before/after dashboard on DORA or SLO — not team sentiment alone.**

### Common Mistakes in Interviews

- Jump to permanent tooling before stabilizing the incident
- Single 90-day big-bang without 30-day quick wins
- No measurable success criteria or executive sponsor
